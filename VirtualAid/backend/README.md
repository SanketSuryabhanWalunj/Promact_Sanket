## BAsic Details
Project name - VirtaulAid 
Project type â€“ multi-layer application 
        Reason: Creates a fully layered solution based on Domain Driven Design practices. Recommended for long-term projects that need a maintainable and extensible codebase. 
UI framework â€“ Angular (Note: we donâ€™t require this so we will remove it in future or abandon it.) 
UI theme â€“ Basic theme  
        Reason: We donâ€™t require UI part so basic theme is selected. 
Database Provider â€“ Entity Framework Core 
Database Mangement System â€“ PostgreSQL 
Mobile support: None 
Separate Identity Server â€“ No 
        Reason: It separates the server side into two applications. The first one is for the identity server and the second one is for your server-side HTTP API. 
Preview (Uses the latest pre-release version) - No 
Separate Solution folder â€“ Yes 
        Reason: Specifies if the project will be in a new folder in the output folder or directly in the output folder. 
Progressive Web Application â€“ No 
        Reason: PWA support is primarily a front-end concern, and it's not tied to the back-end technology.
